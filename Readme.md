## Created travel itinery for Indonesian Getaway

I began by creating a Jupyter Notebook to begin the code
The biggest challenge was getting the heat maps to load.  I determined that I was not able to view the heat maps in Jupyter Notebook.  After working with my tutor Sharon we were able to view the maps in VSCode.  It is unclear why the maps are not visible in Jypyter Notebook.

The coding was finished using VSCode. 

At one point I had an issue with my API key.  I was getting an error message saying the key was not valid.  I attended Office Hours to get help from TA.  It was not clear why my API key was returning an error.  After meeting with the TA I was able to get the API key to work and completed the challenge.

Another obstacle was getting the data to load into the different folders.  I was able to resolve that by moving the folder into the current folder I was creating the code for.  Example.  I was not able to load the code into the Vacation Search until I moved the Weather Database folder into the Vacation Search folder.  Same process when creating the travel itinery.  The itinery code does not include the heat maps.

Weather Database folder is in the Vacation Itinery folder.
